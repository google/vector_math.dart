## 2.2.0-wip

- Performance of functions that take `dynamic` arguments improved.
- Most of the members that take `dynamic` arguments are deprecated. New members
  with non-`dynamic` arguments added.

  Deprecated members:
  - `Matrix4.translate`

    Instead use: `Matrix4.translateByDouble`, `Matrix4.translateByVector3`,
    `Matrix4.translateByVector4`.

  - `Matrix4.leftTranslate`

    Instead use: `Matrix4.leftTranslateByDouble`,
    `Matrix4.leftTranslateByVector3`, `Matrix4.leftTranslateByVector4`.

  - `Matrix4.scale`

    Instead use: `Matrix4.scaleByDouble`, `Matrix4.scaleByVector3`,
    `Matrix4.scaleByVector4`.

  - `Matrix4.scaled`

    Instead use: `Matrix4.scaledByDouble`, `Matrix4.scaledByVector3`,
    `Matrix4.scaledByVector4`.

## 2.1.5

- Fixed `operator -()` of Quaternion (Contributed by tlserver)
- Fixed `Matrix3.rotationY` direction (Contributed by tlserver, moritzblume)
- Added an operator== to Quaternion so that two instances of quaternions can
  be evaluated for equality.
- Require Dart 3.1

## 2.1.4

- Refactor the locations of the `SimplexNoise` related part files.

## 2.1.3

- `operator ==` overrides no longer take nullable arguments. This is only
  visible for classes that implement the interfaces defined in this package
  which no longer need to also widen the argument type.
- Deprecate `SimplexNoise` (see https:github.com/google/vector_math.dart/issues/270
  for more information).

## 2.1.2

- Fix to `Quad.copy` ([#221](https://github.com/google/vector_math.dart/issues/221))
